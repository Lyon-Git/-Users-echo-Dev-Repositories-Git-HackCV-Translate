# 5 ways of looking at Machine Learning… What is ML?

**1)**

**2)** We have solved lot of 2 equation 2 unknown problem.

2x + 3y =5

-4x+7y = 9

Solving Machine learning problem means exactly solving these type of equation. only difference is that in case of ML we have millions of equation, billions of unknown and trillion of possible solution. Our task is to find best solution out of such huge possibility of solution.

**3) Look at below series :**

6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6

6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7

6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13

For computer above all are numbers, For us

in 1st — All are **same**

in 2nd —**increase and decrease** sequence

in 3rd — continuously **increasing**

So, finding such **rule, pattern from Data** is Machine Learning.

**4)**Automation is all about do work in loop like **for and while loop** of programming language.

Then Machine Learning is about automatic **building if/else** part of system.

**5)** Industrial revolution — **Automation**

Current era, Machine Learning — **Automation of automation**

Future, AutoML — **Automation of automation of automation**
